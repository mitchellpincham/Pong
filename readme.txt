I only have comments in the 2player.py file because all of the games are the
same, just the controls are different


1player.py is a 1 player game against the ai the controls are Q and A

mouse.py is the same as 1player.py but movement is controled with the mouse.

2player.py is a 2 player game with the controls being Q and A for the left
paddle, the controls for the right paddle are O and L

2balls.py is 2 player with 2 balls, the controls are the same as the one above
